# Everybody Knows A Shorts Guy

### But here's a little more info about this one.

I've done __many__ things in my life.

- _Server_
- _Manager_
- _Courier_
- _Business Owner_
- _Photographer_
- _REALTOR_                                              

But I’ve always loved tech, and knowing how things work. I’ve largely enjoyed having the newest devices, and then “hacking” them to unlock their full potential. I remember as child, writing boot disks so my computer could run SimCity, or editing the .config files of games to change the physics or resource modifiers. I haven’t done it in a long time, since my career in real estate necessitated stable platforms to work from, but I’m excited to “play” again.
